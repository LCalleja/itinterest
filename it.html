      <p>I have always enjoyed STEM, but it wasn’t until after I had left high school that I realised where my true passions were. Straight after high school I went into Osteopathy as I enjoyed sports science, however, I discovered that wasn’t for me. After some time off I decided to try again and chose to study engineering. At this point in time, I had no firsthand experience with engineers and didn’t really know what I was getting myself into. I chose the chemical discipline as my favourite subject at school was chemistry. </p>
      <p>I chose RMIT due to its’ reputation as being a leader in graduate ready students and its Engineers Australia Accreditation. I am nearly at the end of my undergraduate journey, so it is hard to remember what I thought I was to learn. In hindsight I would have completed more electives based on IT and coding specifically.  </p>
      <p>This semester I am completing this course, Introduction to IT, and last semester I undertook the course Programming Fundamentals for Scientists. Programming Fundamentals for Scientists focused on Python for use in science-based activities and functions. </p>
      <p>As an undergraduate I have had four internships, including my current job as a technical officer, and each had an element of IT experience. The four organisations I have worked with are GHD, Intellectual Property Australia, Deloitte and Partnear. </p>
      <p>At GHD I was placed in D-Lab where I was able to gain a plethora of experience in a range of areas, not just technical skills. My main project was the redevelopment of the Smart Seeds program. Responsibilities included the creation of experience surveys and then write reports on the findings, support and delivery of virtual programs, create content and moderate the Smart Seeds LinkedIn page. I had similar experiences whilst at Deloitte where I was a Tech Strategy and Transformation Vacation Student.</p>
      <p>During my time at IPA, I was hired to be a consultant and offer recommendations on their Competency Based Training (CBT) program for new patent officers to be aligned with the technology-based era. Over the five-week project I reviewed the first stage in its' entirety and created an updated plan to be used in a proposal for future use.</p>
